📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
📌 Overview

This project showcases a complete data analytics pipeline — from loading raw data in Python, performing EDA and cleaning, running SQL analysis on a PostgreSQL server, to building a Power BI dashboard and presenting insights through a Gamma-generated report and presentation.

The goal is to demonstrate strong analytical thinking, SQL proficiency, dashboard development, and storytelling skills using industry-standard tools.

📁 Dataset

Source: dataset.csv (stored in /data/)

Description: (Add a short summary, e.g., customer transactions, sales data, etc.)

Rows: (Add count)

Columns: (Add key column names)

The dataset is used for Python EDA, SQL queries, and visualization in Power BI.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

PostgreSQL + pgAdmin

SQLAlchemy / psycopg2

Power BI Desktop

Gamma App (Report + Presentation)

Git / GitHub

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, data types, and missing values

Saved intermediate cleaned version

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Univariate & multivariate analysis

Outlier detection

Correlation analysis

Data visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, boxplots)

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Treated missing values

Standardized column names

Fixed incorrect data types

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL analysis

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Created PostgreSQL database & table

Loaded cleaned CSV

Executed SQL queries including:

GROUP BY, ORDER BY

JOIN, CASE, IN

Aggregations (AVG, SUM, COUNT)

KPI calculations

Saved all queries in sql_queries.sql

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected to cleaned dataset

Built interactive dashboard:

KPIs (totals, averages, rates)

Trend analysis

Category breakdown

Slicers & visual filters

Dashboard file: /dashboard/dashboard.pbix

6️⃣ Reports & Presentation (Gamma)

Created a structured analytics report

Designed a clean, concise presentation covering:
